# hortus-mundus

This project aims to develop digital plant models for the flora of the world. 

A draft list of fields to record for each model:
- Common name(s)
- Botanic name(s)
- Description
- Quantifiable plant attributes (ie USDA Hardiness Zone, Mature size, water use, required sunlight amount, flower color, and many more)
- Web links (Wikipedia, iNaturalist, USDA Plant database, etc)
- Photos
- Illustrations
- Botanically accurate procedural 3D models (ie Speedtree)
- Hero 3D models (non-procedural and visually beautiful)
- Distribution map
- Species Distribution Model (a predictive distribution map of where the plant may be suitable to grow)
- Plant Community (relational field for other plants that grow as part of the same local system)
